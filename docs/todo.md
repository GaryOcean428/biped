# Biped Platform Optimization Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze and Optimize Backend Architecture
- [x] Audit current backend structure for redundancy and duplication
- [x] Consolidate multiple main.py files into single optimized version
- [x] Create modular service layer architecture
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Optimize database models and relationships
- [ ] Create unified API response format
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [x] Clean up unused imports and dependencies
- [x] Remove duplicate auth routes (auth.py, admin_auth.py, dev_auth.py)

## Phase 2: Create Comprehensive User Management System
- [ ] Create unified user service for all user types (customer, provider, admin, developer)
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Create comprehensive profile management for each user type
- [ ] Implement proper authentication middleware
- [ ] Create user-specific dashboard routing
- [ ] Implement account settings and preferences
- [ ] Add proper password management and security

## Phase 3: Optimize Frontend Components and Routing
- [x] Create global CSS configuration and design system
- [x] Build reusable UI component library
- [x] Implement shared JavaScript utilities and modules
- [x] Create consistent styling variables and themes
- [ ] Implement proper client-side routing
- [ ] Create user-type specific interfaces using shared components
- [ ] Optimize static file serving with component-based architecture
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Create responsive design system for all user types
- [ ] Clean up duplicate CSS and JavaScript
- [x] Establish global configuration for fonts, colors, and spacing

## Phase 4: Implement Comprehensive Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test authentication flows for all user types
- [ ] Validate account management features
- [ ] Test API endpoints with proper error handling
- [ ] Validate responsive design across devices
- [ ] Test user experience flows end-to-end
- [ ] Validate security and access controls
- [ ] Test component library reusability

## Phase 5: Deploy Optimized Solution
- [ ] Deploy optimized backend with all fixes
- [ ] Validate production deployment
- [ ] Test live authentication and account management
- [ ] Monitor performance and error rates
- [ ] Document final architecture and features
- [ ] Document component library and global configurations
